Write a route ('/form') that processes HTML form input (<form><input name="str"/></form>) and prints backwards the str value.

HINTS

To handle POST request use the post() method which is used the same way as get():

  app.post('/path', function(req, res){...})

Express.js use middleware to provide extra functionality to your web server.
Simply put, a middleware is a function invoked by Express.js before your own request handler.
Middlewares provide a large variety of functionalities such as logging, serving static files and error handling.
A middleware is added by calling use() on the application and passing the middleware as a parameter.

To parse x-ww-form-urlencoded request bodies Express.js can use urlencoded() middleware (from Connect library):

  app.use(connect.urlencoded())

Here is how we can flip the characters:

  req.body.str.split('').reverse().join('')
-----------------------------

NOTE

Avoid using soon to be depricated bodyParser() middleware.

When creating your projects from scratch, install connect dependency with NPM.

Again, the port to use is passed {appname} to the application as process.argv[2].
